Obtuse audio plugin frameworks and specious realtime constraints present an immense wall to music production in high-level languages. This project aims to surmount them.

# Implementation status

Short term goals are to support MIDI sequencing of CLAP instruments, with both offline and realtime rendering. Longer term goals are to develop higher level languages to support intelligent playback like [NotePerformer](https://www.noteperformer.com/). See [this vi-control post](https://vi-control.net/community/threads/is-it-time-for-sound-rendering.48604/post-4889885) for an explanation why MIDI alone is inadequate.

## Architecture

![architecture](architecture.png)

## Modules

- [x] sequencer
- [ ] CLAP plugin host (via [clap-hs](https://github.com/JBetz/clap-hs))
- [ ] VST plugin host
- [x] audio I/O (via [portaudio](http://www.portaudio.com/))
- [ ] MIDI device routing

## API

See [ensemble.tl](./ensemble.tl) for a [Type Language](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/TL) specification of the API.

There are three ways to interface with an ensemble server, via stdin and stdout pipes, a WebSocket, or HTTP.

<b>For pipes:</b> 
```bash 
./ensemble --interface pipes
```

Messages are sent by writing JSON to stdin, and responses are returned as JSON via stdout. All calls are asynchronous, so messages need to be tagged using the `@extra` field in order to route them back to their senders.

Example:

```bash
$ ./ensemble --interface pipes
{ "@type": "getAudioDevices", "@extra": 855818240 }
{ "@type":"AudioDevices", "@extra": 855818240, "audioDevices": [{"name": "Microsoft Sound Mapper - Input", "index": 0}, { "name": "Speakers (Realtek (R) Audio)","index": 1}]}
```

<b>For WebSocket:</b>
```bash
./ensemble --interface websocket --port 3000
```

The WebSocket endpoint will be available at `localhost:<port>`, and the same rules for message tagging apply.

<b>For HTTP:</b> 
```bash
./ensemble --interface http --port 3000
```

Messages are sent via POST requests to `localhost:<port>/send` with JSON in request body, and responses are returned synchronously as JSON in response body.

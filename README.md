Obtuse audio plugin frameworks and specious realtime constraints present an immense wall to music production in high-level languages. This project aims to surmount them.

# Implementation status

Short term goals are to support MIDI sequencing of CLAP instruments, with both offline and realtime rendering. Longer term goals are to develop higher level languages to support intelligent playback like [NotePerformer](https://www.noteperformer.com/). See [this vi-control post](https://vi-control.net/community/threads/is-it-time-for-sound-rendering.48604/post-4889885) for an explanation why MIDI alone is inadequate.

## Architecture

![architecture](architecture.png)

## Modules

- [x] sequencer
- [ ] CLAP plugin host (via [clap-hs](https://github.com/JBetz/clap-hs))
- [ ] VST plugin host
- [x] audio I/O (via [portaudio](http://www.portaudio.com/))
- [ ] MIDI device routing

## API

See [ensemble.tl](./ensemble.tl) for a [Type Language](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/TL) specification of the API.

<b>To run a WebSocket server:</b>
```bash
./ensemble --interface websocket --port 3000
```

The WebSocket endpoint will be available at `localhost:<port>`. Note that all calls are asynchronous, so messages need to be tagged using the `@extra` field in order to route them back to their senders.

Example request and response payloads:
```json
{ "@type": "getAudioDevices", "@extra": 855818240 }
{ "@type":"AudioDevices", "@extra": 855818240, "audioDevices": [ { "name": "Microsoft Sound Mapper - Input", "index": 0}, { "name": "Speakers (Realtek (R) Audio)","index": 1 } ] }
```

## Platforms

- [ ] unix
- [x] windows
